Doesn't require OpenTracker anymore, tracker data is being kept in Mnesia now.


You will need MochiWeb from: http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/
Bind address and port may be specified by environment variables MOCHIWEB_IP and
MOCHIWEB_PORT.

To configure, run:

application:set_env(chaosbay, http_base, "http://...").
torrent:reset_tracker_urls().
