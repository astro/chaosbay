Doesn't require OpenTracker anymore, tracker data is being kept in Mnesia now.

- You will need erlang-collectd from: http://github.com/astro/erlang-collectd/
- You will need MochiWeb from: https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb
  - Bind address and port may be specified by environment variables MOCHIWEB_IP and
    MOCHIWEB_PORT.
  - You need to set the environment variable 'http_base' for the chaosbay application
- You furthermore need epqsql https://github.com/wg/epgsql
  - Use test_schema.sql to create the required tables
  - Still uses hard coded credential (change in sql_conns.erl)

To configure, run:

application:set_env(chaosbay, http_base, "http://...").
torrent:reset_tracker_urls().
